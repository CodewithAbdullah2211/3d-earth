      <p class="description">Earth, the third planet from the Sun, has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918
        miles) and is unique for its ability to support life. Approximately 71% of its surface is covered by water, with
        oceans being the predominant feature. The planet's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen
        (21%), providing a suitable environment for diverse ecosystems such as forests, deserts, and tundras. Earth's
        core, made of iron and nickel, generates a magnetic field that protects the planet from solar radiation.
        Orbiting the Sun at an average distance of 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles), Earth experiences
        seasons due to its axial tilt of 23.5 degrees. Its surface is dynamic, shaped by tectonic plates that cause
        earthquakes and volcanic activity.</p>
